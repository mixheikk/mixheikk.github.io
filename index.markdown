I'm an associate machine learning researcher at Telef√≥nica Research, Barcelona. My research is mostly focused on trustworthy machine learning, especially on privacy-preserving (differentially private) machine learning. I'm also interested in learning from distributed data, e.g., federated learning, as well as Bayesian learning. I received my PhD in 2023 from the Department of Statistics, University of Helsinki, Finland.
